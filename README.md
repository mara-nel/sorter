Little game to drag objects onto the correct side.

Gameplay:

The main game screen includes a safe/recieving zone on each end. In the middle of these objects of 2 types will be spawned and need to be dragged into their corresponding zone. If this is not done soon enough or one is dragged into the wrong zone, then they explode and the game ends.
